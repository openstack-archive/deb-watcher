"""
An efficacy specfication is a contract that is associated to each :ref:`Goal
<goal_definition>` that defines the various :ref:`efficacy indicators
<efficacy_indicator_definition>` a strategy achieving the associated goal
should provide within its :ref:`solution <solution_definition>`. Indeed, each
solution proposed by a strategy will be validated against this contract before
calculating its :ref:`global efficacy <efficacy_definition>`.
